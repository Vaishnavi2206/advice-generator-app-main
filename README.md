## Overview

The challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

1. I created a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a public project. This makes it easier to share my code with the community if I need help. I reviewed the [Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/) to ensure I set it up correctly.

2. I configured my repository to publish my code to a web address. This is useful for sharing the URL of my project along with my repo URL if I need assistance. I explored various methods and chose the best one for my project.

3. I examined the designs to start planning how to approach the project. This helped me think about the CSS classes Iâ€™d need and how to create reusable styles.

4. I structured my content with HTML before adding any styles. Focusing on the HTML first ensured my content was well-organized and ready for styling.

5. I wrote the base styles for the project, including general content styles like `font-family` and `font-size`.

6. I started adding styles from the top of the page and worked my way down, making sure to complete each section to my satisfaction before moving on to the next one.
